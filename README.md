# Modbus Local Gateway component

This is a Home Assistant integration to support modbus devices running behind a Modbus TCP gateway.

## Device support

The has been tested with a WaveShare Wi-Fi to RS485 gateway (https://www.waveshare.com/rs485-to-wifi-eth.htm) Configured as a Modbus RTU to Modbus TCP gateway.

Slave devices for testing have been:
* Growatt MIN-6000-TL-XH
* Growatt MIC-2500-TL-X
* Eastron SDM230
* Finder 7M.38
* Finder 7M.24

Note that devices sometimes get firmware upgrades, or incompatible versions are sold under the same model name, so it is possible that the device will not work despite being listed.

Support for additional devices can be added via yaml configuration files in the devices folder.
Existing configuration files can be used as templates.

integrations for Home Assistant. Once you have HACS set up, simply click the button below (requires My Homeassistant configured) or
follow the [instructions for adding a custom
repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories) and then
the integration will be available to install like any other.
